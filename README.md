# Fundraising-Analysis
## Overview of Project
In this projected I made an interactive dashboard to help understand the funds made from the fundraising campaign.
### Purpose
To help understand the funds collected from the fundraising compaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
In this project shapes, codes, amd pivot tabels were used in order to get the best outcome.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This was a fun one to make it helped me organize the date and the money made the time frame of the Campaign.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This one was very helpful to make because this helps you get percentages of the money that was earned and if the goal was reached. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It was hard understanding the pivot table but I eventully got it and it helped me organize the funds.
## Results
The Result of this was a very well organized Dashboard that was interactive which allowed the data to be specific and percise. It was hard to get where I am with this project but now ive gained the ability to make more that are similar to the one I currently made.
